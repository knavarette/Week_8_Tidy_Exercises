# tidyr


## Your Turn 1

On a sheet of paper, draw how the cases data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **country**, **year**, **n**


tidyr is transitioning `gather()` to `pivot_longer()`.  Here are equivalent codes:
```{r}
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "year", values_to = "n", 2:4)
cases %>% gather(key="year",value="n", 2:4)
```



## Your Turn 2
Try the following codes - what do they do? (annotate them with a comment)

```{r}
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", 2:4) #Values of column names and maps them to the new variable "year" and the cell values to "n" by using 2:4
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to= "n", c("2011", "2012", "2013")) #Values of column names and maps them to the new variable "year" and the cell values to "n" by naming the columns   
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", starts_with("201")) #Values of column names and maps them to the new variable "year" and the cell values to "n" by using the function`starts_with` to grab column names that start with "201" 
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", -Country) #Values of column names and maps them to the new variable "year" and the cell values to "n" by using all the columns except for the Country one. 
```



## Your Turn 3

Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "year", values_to = "cases", 2:3, names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) %>% 
  write_csv("newtable4a.csv") 
```


## Your Turn 4

On a sheet of paper, draw how this data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**

```{r}
pollution %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = size, values_from = amount)
```

## Your Turn 5

Use `pivot_wider()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**.

```{r}
table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

# who


## Your Turn 6

Gather the 5th through 60th columns of `who` into columns named `codes` and `n`.

Then select just the `county`, `year`, `codes` and `n` variables.

```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "codes", values_to ="n", cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3) 

```



Run the following code
```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to ="codes", values_to = "n", cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3) %>%
  separate(codes, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = c(4, 7)) %>% 
  select(-new) 
```




## Your Turn 7

Separate the `sexage` column into `sex` and `age` columns.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_________` before running the code)*

```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to ="codes", values_to = "n", cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3) %>%
  separate(codes, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>%
  select(-new) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex","age"), sep=1)
```

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.
